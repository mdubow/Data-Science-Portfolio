# Capstone Project 1: Predicting Overdose Risk from Opioid Prescriptions

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict risk of opioid overdose given a variety of background factors, including location, race, age, and sex.

Keywords: Python, Pandas, Sklearn, Lasso Regression, Supervised Learning, Healthcare and Research

# Capstone Project 2: Bar Crawl - Detecting Heavy Drinking

This project uses accelerometer and blood alcohol data collected from 13 participants of a large bar crawl event. With the aim of machine learning, the aim is to predict whether an individual is drunk based on their movement. Movement is analyzed by computing the variance within the accelerometer position data over a 30-minute window after blood alcohol readings are registered.
