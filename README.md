# Capstone Project 1: Predicting Overdose Risk from Opioid Prescriptions

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict risk of opioid overdose given a variety of background factors, including location, race, age, and sex.

Keywords: Python, Pandas, Sklearn, Lasso Regression, Supervised Learning, Healthcare and Research

# Capstone Project 2: Bar Crawl - Detecting Heavy Drinking

This project uses accelerometer and blood alcohol data collected from 13 participants of a large bar crawl event. Through machine learning, the aim is to predict whether an individual is drunk based on their movement. Movement is analyzed by computing the variance within the accelerometer position data over a 30-minute window after blood alcohol readings are registered.

# Project 3: Job Search

Given a resume, the model of this project is able to find the best match among thousands of job postings. The program uses the Gensim natural language processing library to first convert the text of the job postings into word vectors and then compute the similarities between words within the vector space. A query document (resume) can also be tokenized and converted to vectors in order to compute its similarities. The query document is then checked against the corpus of job postings and the best matches are returned.
